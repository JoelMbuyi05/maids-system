                <p>CleanCare operates a **platform connecting Clients (those seeking cleaning services) with Cleaners (independent contractors providing services)**. CleanCare facilitates booking, payment processing, communication, and basic scheduling but **does not directly employ Cleaners** or perform the cleaning services itself.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>**Clients:** Provide accurate service location, access details, and ensure a safe working environment for the Cleaner.</li>

                    <li>**All Users:** Refrain from attempting to circumvent the platform to book services directly (poaching).</li>
                    <li>Do not upload or share content (e.g., photos of homes) without proper consent.</li>

                    <li>**Service Fees:** CleanCare deducts a service fee (commission) from the Cleaner's pay, which is outlined in the Cleaner Agreement.</li>
                    <li>**Cancellations:** Users are subject to a cancellation policy (e.g., late cancellation fees) which will be detailed separately and may be updated.</li>
